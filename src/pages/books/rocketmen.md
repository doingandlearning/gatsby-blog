I didn't know much about the Apollo 8 program at all before I read this book.
It does a good job of setting up the challenge and motivation to take on this 
journey. 1968 was a fraught year and this achievement managed to rescue some 
semblance of positivity from it.

I felt the book could do with a bit more editing - there were a few times that
facts and anecdotes were repeated and the style was sometimes disjointed and 
a bit dull. Saying that, I enjoyed the book overall and have added to my facts
about the space program and this first successful moonshot.

I was struck by how male this book was. The title should have given it away but
still given all we've learned about women and POC being integral and overlooked
in this race, it was disappointing not to hear and see more.
