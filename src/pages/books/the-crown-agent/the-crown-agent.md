This was a fun book that brought an unsuspecting doctor through Scotland and to
Jamaica to unravel a mystery. I read on a gloomy day, warm under a blanket while
the rain beat against the windows. This certainly reflected the weather in most
of the book and helped me get in the mood. If you like mystery novels mixed with
some historical fiction then this is for you.
