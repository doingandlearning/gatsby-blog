I've read so much about the meditations, I thought it was worth reading them. I haven't translated much Latin since my A-Levels, so this translation was needed. I liked the translation and appreciated some of the insights Marcus brings. While I'm not sure I always agree with his philosophical perspective I found it though provoking.
