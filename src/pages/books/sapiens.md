I thought I'd read this book already but I think it had been referenced by so many other works that I just got confused. I think I enjoyed it, I learnt some interesting things and it's made me ask interesting questions about the direction we're going in as a species. It's interesting to find someone equally dismissive of capitalism as Christianity. It's a long read and not always the most stimulating but I felt it was worthwhile.
