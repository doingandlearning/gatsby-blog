      <p>
        I started writing code as a kid but got distracted by Maths, teaching
        Maths and school leadership. After 12 years working in schools and
        coding on the side, I left the classroom and started making cool things
        for the internet full time. I work in a variety of technologies but
        always want to use the best technology for the job. I help solve
        problems with lines of code. On the backend, I'll reach for PHP, Python
        or NodeJS. I enjoy using them on their own and as parts of more complete
        frameworks. On the frontend, I'll generally use React, recently with
        NextJs. When working with Laravel, Wordpress and Drupal, I'll generally
        use PHP templating or Vue components.
