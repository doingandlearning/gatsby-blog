I hadn't realised that Beholders Eye was the first in a trilogy. I'd found the 
first book okay and thought I'd give this one ago. Actually, it was much better.

The main characters, a human and a shape-shifter, were both better developed 
through the course of the book. I enjoyed seeing them 50 years after the events
of the first and seeing how that had worked out.

As most sci-fi does, it was an interesting view into the xenophobia, tribalism
and the rest. Alongside that it was a good who-dun-it and adventure romping
around space. I'm looking forward to getting stuck into the third.
