Man. I'm now very conscious of where all my data is. To be fair, since the break in 013 I've been aware but this excellent account of the why and the how makes a more poignant wake-up call. No doubt in typing this hear and then putting it online I will be logged somewhere but it's worth it if only to say this is a book worth reading.
