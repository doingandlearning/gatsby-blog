As an old-school D&D player, I initially thought that this book might be set in
the Forgotten Realms and refer to a Beholder. Not so, this is indeed about 
appreciating what is in the eye of the beholder. 

The protagonist is a 'young' shape-shifter of only a few centuries, just about
trusted to control their powers. Part of a web/hive mind that shares experience
by eating and being eaten, they hide their existence while also trying to save
the universe.

A fun, easy read. It's an older book now and the tropes felt well trodden. At 
various points I felt I'd read the book before but I think there are just a lot
of books that deal with similar themes in similar ways.
