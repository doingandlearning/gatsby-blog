I like making things. I don't make them as much as I'd like or invest anywhere
near the amount of time I think I should.

My job now is mostly to make things on the internet - that's cool and all, but I
love making things made of atoms too.

Adam does a great job of allowing us to follow him through his model-making 
journey - from early work, Star Wars Episode I and Mythbusters. He tries to 
debunk the feeling that writers, coders, cooks and the like are not makers. 
Alongside that he gives some good advice to get back on the maker horse.

Been scoping out my home office to see if I can get some cleaner making tools in 
here. Maybe some more cardboard?
