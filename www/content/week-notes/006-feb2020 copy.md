These two weeks were a bit sporadic. I travelled to visit family in Arizona which was a lot of fun and fitted in some work around that.

## Reading

I did some. Checkout [books I've read](/books) if you want to know a bit more.

## Fitness

In the week I was in Brighton, I managed to get to the gym 5 times. While I was in Arizona, there wasn't much in terms of fitness and I didn't eat well. I'm feeling the need to jump into some more fitness and better eating in the weeks and months to come.
