Inspired by Maggie Appleton's tweet this week, I've been thinking again about
digital gardens.

I love learning and I love learning in public (I've written about that elsewhere on this blog). I've read and thought a lot about that over the past 15 years, as an educator and a learner, and I've been thinking about how to make more concrete artifacts.

This has been a culmination of thinking, from Tom Critchlow talking about the difference between [`stock` and `flow`](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) in digital gardens, to [Joel Hook](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) and [Amy Hoy](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/)'s thinking around this and swyx thinking about [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/). Add that to the book I read over the Christmas holidays on [`How to take smart notes`](https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y) and Tiago Forte's concept of [intermediate packets](https://fortelabs.co/blog/just-in-time-pm-4-intermediate-packets) and my brain just exploded.

The lock-down made me press pause on a lot of my thinking - my PTSD symptoms spiked and life became a bit harder but I seem to be getting a bit more on top of things now.

So, I want to build a wiki like [Tom's](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) but probably with some kind of visual language like [Buster's](https://busterbenson.com/piles/). Ian pointed out that John Ortander did some work on this already [here](https://github.com/johno/digital-garden) but that project hasn't seen a lot of love recently.

As I begin to do this, I've done some [yak-shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving). I've restructured blog content, moved week notes, moved the blog to use Tailwind and MDX and introduced a brief homepage. Knowing that I want this to be useful I thought I should actually produce some content while doing this.

I'm in a place now where I think I have a grasp of the moving parts, so hopefully the wiki section of this site will be up and running soon.
