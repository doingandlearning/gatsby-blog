I worked through Kyle's course as an introduction to XState. I'd heard about the library before. [My notes](https://github.com/eggheadio-projects/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate-notes) are over here and the course is [here](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate). I feel like I understand the library but I'm not sure yet how to build this into my daily workflow.
