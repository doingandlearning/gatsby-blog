It's hard to believe that it is 2020. That totally feels like the future. I saw
a post over on [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2020/01/its-2020-and-youre-in-the-future.html)
which draws out some interesting observations around this.

This has been the first week back after the holidays. We had a long break and
it was fun getting back up and running. At [SpinUp](https://www.spin-up.io),
we've been working on a prototype which has been using a lot of Next with MongoDB
as the datastore. Since we're using Zeit for hosting, we've been implementing this
without using Express and using the NextJS API routes.

This has given us lots to think about with serverless, mongoose and MongoDB.
Thinking through the models required for each route and ensuring they have been
initialised is even more important in this scenario. With Express, the connections
and models can be started in advance, in a serverless scenario these connections
cannot be assumed.

I've been thinking more about my knowledge management system and been trying out
[Roam](https://www.roamresearch.com). So far, I've enjoyed it more than Notion
because of the ease of creating and linking pages. I'm preferring Roam because
of the speed as well - Notion is very powerful but it isn't speed. Roam doesn't
have a mobile app yet but I'm hoping when they do, it will be as fast as the
web app.

Since, I read "How to Take Smart Notes" I've been using my Kindle to take notes
as I go, importing them onto the computer and filing them in Roam. This has been
really helpful and has got me thinking about things like this, week notes. Let's
see if these new habits take and allow my learning to produce more helpful artifacts.
