          The idea of this space is to create a "digital garden", a place for my
          ideas and thinking to have space to grow and develop in the wild.
        </p>
        <p className="text py-3">
          When I'm not tending my garden by reading or writing, I'm normally
          hanging out with my wife and family or building prototypes and
          products. Find out more <a href="https://spin-up.io">here</a>.

          alongside the awesome people at
