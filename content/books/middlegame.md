This is the first book I've managed to start and finish since lockdown. Before the
world became a different place, I was reading 2 or 3 books a week. That's become
more challenging as my concentration levels have struggled.

I really enjoyed this book - even if I still don't really understand some of the
things that happened. That's probably the point, though - that not everything is
understandable with words or numbers.

It was an awesome adventure combining science, literature and alchemy. The characters
were solid and well-written, the plot was engaging and fun.
