This was an interesting book, told from the perspective of two main female characters. Each one, flawed in her own way, tells the story set in this world which doesn't rotate relative to it's sun - so is half darkness, half light and all human life lives in the twilight.

There are some interesting observations about how we forget the past in order to make sense of the present - each are in obscurity, each are shaped by fantasies and desires for what might have been or what might be.

Do we change or stay the same? Do we cling to old ideologies or do we look for new patterns and way of being in new circumstances? Like the alien crocodiles, do we see bioengineering and geoengineering as two halves of the same equation? Adapting to the environment even as we change the environment to ourselves.
