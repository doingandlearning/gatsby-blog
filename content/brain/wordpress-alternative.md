# Pain

## &ldquo;content source for my Gatbsy site&rdquo;

## &ldquo;require installation of plug-ins on WordPress&rdquo;

## &ldquo;I cannot do to a blog on WP.com&rdquo;

## Should I:

### &ldquo;Run a hosted WP&rdquo; - maybe a container

### Switch to Sanity.io or Contentful

### Something else

## &ldquo;My blog is already runnin fine&rdquo;

## &ldquo;do not feel like rewriting everythin again&rdquo;

## &ldquo;I wish I could just swap the source and everything would work fine.&rdquo;

# Jargon

# Recommendations

advice what to buy, read, share, try&#x2026; or NOT to

## Modify the current plugin

## Sanity.io - &ldquo;Not as flexible as I needed.&rdquo;

## ButterCMS

## &ldquo;The new WPGatsby plugin is only required if you are using Gatsby Cloud builds.&rdquo;
