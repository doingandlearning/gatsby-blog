It is hot here - 30C - which for other places I know this isn't hot but we don't have AC in the UK and we do like to talk about the weather.

## The Little Schemer

I took a break from the other two books today to look at the Little Schemer. This is an old book but it is very helpful for LISP. I really like the style of this book - the whole left hand side it questions and the right hand side is answers. Each question follows on and leads you to deepen your thinking on recursion and list processing. I've found it great.

## Sync!

I spent a few hours on a call with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/_jonesian">Ian</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/zacjones83">Zac</a>. We started to plan out a project about converting morse code to text (<a href="https://github.com/doingandlearning/clojure-morse-code">repo is here if you want to join in</a>). Then we solved some 4Clojure problems together which was a lot of fun.

We did three - once each for us driving and talking them through. I learnt a lot. It's good to think out loud and hear others do the same.
