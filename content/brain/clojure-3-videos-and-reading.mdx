- tags:: [[Clojure]] [[ClojureFam]]

I'm camping today (and for the next 3 days)(in campervan with electricity though), so my Clojure work was pushed into weird corners of my day. I watched a few Youtube videos at x1.5 from the Clojure community which I got a bit from.

## Videos

Rich Hickey created Clojure and the community loves him! I can see why. His approach is genuine, kind and down-to-earth. I really appreciate his depth of insight and this '10 Year of Clojure' talk was really interesting.

This was a very funny talk - 'Every Clojure Talk Ever'. Like any good parody it pulls out each of the common patterns, pokes fun at it and then draws out some useful things.

Derek is one of the speakers from the last video and this is a great explanation about why he builds his company on Clojure.

Rick Hickey again, talking about the mistakes he has made as a language creator and the problems that has called for everyone else. Again, really clear and humble - really helpfully opinionated.

## Continuing with problems

I've been continuing to work on the 4Clojure problems. I don't understand the order of the problems and find some of the "easy" and "elementary" problems quite challenging. The problem numbers also aren't in the listing, so if you are trying to do them in order you have to navigate from the URL.

## Continuing with the reading

I read Chapter 4 of [[Clojure from the Ground Up]] - I reckon if I had have read this before I started the 4Clojure problems then I would have found them more useful. There are a lot of helpful methods built into the core and again I'm so impressed with being able to get the documentation and source code so quickly.

I can't imagine being able to look up the source code of a Javascript function and I don't know where I'd look to find it. The fact that Clojure is built on Clojure means that I could imagine at some point in the future being able to contribute to the language itself. Most languages I've used in the past (most languages?) are actually a higher-level of some other language that is required to extend the language itself. Python, Javascript and PHP - none of them are written in the language itself - I think this is a Clojure advantage!
