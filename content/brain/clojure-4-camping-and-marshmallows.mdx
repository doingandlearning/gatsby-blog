I'm still in a field with dodgy Internet - who knew that fields didn't have good WiFi? I managed a 4 hour walk with the fam, some awesome pizza and a extra naps, so it's all good!

With my weak WiFi, I could still keep going on my Clojure journey. My cohort were wondering if we had marshmallows in England while we were camping.

## 4Clojure

Managed a few more of these - I don't think I'm thinking in a very Clojure way. Stuart (@shanberg) passed on advice he'd received to read the whole of the source code and I think I might start reading clojure.core. I have been using `source` to get more context on some of the functions but I think I could be more deliberate about this.

## From the Ground Up

I read a few more chapters from the book - skipping Chapter 5 on Macros. I saw somewhere a suggestion to circle back to this and I'm going to do that. The logistics chapter seemed pretty straight-forward and similar to other platforms I'm familar with. Testing seems pretty straightforward as well which is cool.

There were some lines on the chapter on state which were pretty mindblowing:

> Identity is a skein we lay across the world of immutable facts; a single entity which encompasses change. In programming, identities unify different values over time. Identity types are mutable references to immutable values.

Also, I learnt that Clojure refers to @ as the wormhole operator - awesome!

## For the Brave

I've worked through the 2 introductory chapters of this book and managed to get my Emacs environment to a workable state for coding which is cool. I'm getting used to some more new key commands which is speeding up what I'm doing!

## Async Learning

I've really appreciated our Discord chat. As expected, journeying with others is a lot more fun and is helping me stay motivated. We're keeping a track of our individual completion on a shared <a href="https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/issues/53">Github issue</a>. This has been pretty cool. As we're all working through 4Clojure together, we can see how others have answered the same problem.

I think it might be useful to have a mix of some syncronous learning at some point - a few jumped on a call to work some problems together and I think I'd appreciate that going forward from time to time.
