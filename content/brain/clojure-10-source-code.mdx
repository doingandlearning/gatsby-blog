# One step forwards &#x2026;

So, Ian asked on our ClojureFam chat if anyone had got the source code for [Clojure from the ground up: logistics](https://aphyr.com/posts/311-clojure-from-the-ground-up-logistics) working. I admitted that I just read the source code rather than trying to get it up and running so decided I'd try to do it today.

My first exciting thing to notice is that you just declare dependencies in the project file and they get installed - that's cool!

Getting to parse JSON files is another good thing to have tried and to understand. Again, I read it before but going to the effort to reproduce it on my local environment is cool.

Another thing that I need to remember is that there is no "hoisting" - if you use a function it has to have been defined previously in the code. I noticed this in the Clojure Core source code - that things were being built up and at various points there were comments about what was now available.

# Problems

I'm still working through the 4Clojure problems. They are good practice and really test understanding - though some of them are more esoteric. You can only see the solutions of people you follow so we're sharing ours in our group. That's a lot of fun - to see how others are solving.

# Other learnings &#x2026;

Ed made some stuff based on a Functional Programming video course. I'm going to check that out soon.
