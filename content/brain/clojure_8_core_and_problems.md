# clojure.core

I took some time this morning to read through the Clojure Core source code. There are some methods there which it was good to see, approaches which were awesome to see - I'm getting a little better at this Clojure stuff but I know I am missing key bits.

As a web dev, I don't know how to interact with APIs or DBs which is always a bit worrying 8 days into working with a language (for me at least).

# Emacs

I'm continuing with my Emacs journey. I'm reading all of the Doom recommended tutorials and documentation to make sure that I'm not missing obvious things. The book we are looking at is for Emacs rather than Doom and I want to be clear on the differences and things I need to adjust for.

## Chapter 4

This was a fun chatper - going deeper on some of the core functions and thinking about these. Interesting that Clojure programs to abstractions.

Enjoying the Emacs code block evaluation to help with note taking and experimenting.
