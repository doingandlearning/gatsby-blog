I don't know if this is officially day 1 or if I'm being pre-emptive.

I've been getting things setup, got my notes and tracking base started. I'm going to be using Emacs as my code editor and I've got the REPL and compiler setup for that. I've also got `Leiningen` installed and setup so I can build and scaffold projects. 

I read and took notes on the first two chapter of [[Clojure from the Ground Up]]. Just exploring the grammar of clojure and the type system. It is all so consistent and concise. I love it.
