It's hot in my field. I guess it could be worse - it could be raining :) It is England after all. 

I've not been at my desk and find it a bit more challenging to read and take notes when I'm not in situ. I think I'd like to get better at that - I love sitting at my editor taking notes but maybe I'd like a more portable arrangement. I've got my iPad and pencil, so it should be possible!

## Ground Up

I finished reading from the Ground Up. I haven't finished taking notes (see the previous thought!) but I found the last two chapters interesting enough.

The modelling was cool - spherical and cartesian geometry are things I've played with a lot and using them to implement the rocket made sense. These felt more like higher-order programming concepts rather than Clojure per-se.

Equally, the last chapter on debugging starts with Polya's book on Problem Solving (an awesome book I have on my shelf and refer to a lot when I need reminders of strategies for problem solving - have you tried simplifying? Have you thought of an adjacent problem? Etc?). Debugging is a vital skill and the second half of this chapter pointed out some useful ways to read and interpret the error messages given out by Clojure.

## Brave and True

I read Chapter 3 of Brave and True. These chapters are pretty dense with a lot going on in them. The style is quite informal and funny - I don't know if that is because I'm in the target demographic or if everyone would find it funny. This was recapping a lot of the things that Ground Up covered but in a slightly different way which definitely helped reinforce some of the concepts.

## I want to build something!

I am not normally who learns well by reading textbooks. I like to be practical and build things. The Apprenticeship Patterns book from O'Reilly has a concept of Breakable Toys - creating things to help push learning forwards. Zac pointed me toward the <a href="https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/workshop/additional-projects/">https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/workshop/additional-projects/</a> project for some ideas. From that, I thought I'd like to try to implement a morse code translator. So a few of us are going to get together and try to do that together tomorrow. This is a tip towards the sometimes syncronous approach that I was mentioning yesterday.

## 4Clojure

I've been continuing to work through these problems. They are some of them more fun than others. There are good reminders to look back over the methods that are available in the language and try to use Clojure the way that makes most sense.
