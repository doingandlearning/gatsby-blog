I managed to get a chunk of problems on 4Clojure finished today - they're quite fun!
I remember working through Euler problems when I was learning to code but I haven't
done these koan style problems in a while. 

It's quite an old site and is slow but it's pretty cool and it does the job.

We kicked off our learning group - Thanes - God of Creation - I was reading something
about a weird Dionynus->Thanes death/resurrection cult which apparently rose to
rival Christianity in 400CE or so. I don't think we are up for that! But creativity
and thought are two other aspects of Thanes that would be good to reflect during 
this time.

[[Clojure from the Ground Up]] is a fun resource. Really well written and really helpful.
My notes for that are linked above.

The thing that excited me most about Clojure today was the `source` function. With
it you can see the base Clojure code of all of the core functions.

For example,

``` clojure
(source +)
```

returns 

``` clojure
(defn +
  "Returns the sum of nums. (+) returns 0. Does not auto-promote
  longs, will throw on overflow. See also: +'"
  {:inline (nary-inline 'add 'unchecked_add)
   :inline-arities >1?
   :added "1.2"}
  ([] 0)
  ([x] (cast Number x))
  ([x y] (. clojure.lang.Numbers (add x y)))
  ([x y & more]
     (reduce1 + (+ x y) more)))
```

That's so cool!

Frustrations have been trying to get Emacs to be setup the way I want it to be 
for Clojure. I'm using Doom Emacs which I think is why things aren't as straight-
forward as they might be but I'm going to persevere.
