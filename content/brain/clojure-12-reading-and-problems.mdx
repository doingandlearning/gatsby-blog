# More reading

I've kept going with my Clojure reading. The heat had been pretty epic and I've been diving deeply in Emacs.

# Book groups

I had two book groups today - one on Emacs (we're reading Master Emacs - this weeks chapter wasn't great but we geeked out about Emacs so that's okay!).

The other was on Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friend & Influence People - an oldie but a goodie. Interesting that this book group is of the style where we come and read it together - there is no pre-work, we take turns reading aloud and reflect on what we read. I found it really helpful (even though I had to stay up past my bedtime for it!)
