# Grammar of LISP


<a id="org3c8a99f"></a>

## Values (nouns):

-   nil
-   Boolean (true and false)
-   Numbers (1, -47, 1.2e-4, 1/3)
-   Strings ("Hi there!")


<a id="orgcaad873"></a>

## Symbol (verbs):

-   Points toward a value
-   Clojure evaluates to get the meaning
-   Can be a value or a function


<a id="org7ab3a02"></a>

## Escape expression

-   Use a single quote to escape an expression.
-   Rather than evaluating the expression, is simply returns the text unchanged.


<a id="org9e5c50f"></a>

## List (Tree of language)

-   (1 2 3) - single expression which has multiple parts.
-   Evaluates from the inside out (BODMAS/PEDMAS)
-   First element is a pointer to a &rsquo;verb&rsquo; - function or symbol pointing to function


<a id="orgc5e4fea"></a>

# Basic Types (nouns)

[Clojure from the ground up: basic types](https://aphyr.com/posts/302-clojure-from-the-ground-up-basic-types)
Clojure has a strong type system - operations on improper types are not allowed.

Clojure types are dynamic - they are enforced when the program is run rather than when it is compiled.


<a id="org07dbf70"></a>

## Integers

-   Long (MAX<sub>VALUE</sub> == 9223372036854775807)
-   BigInt
-   Short (MAX<sub>VALUE</sub> == 32767)
-   Byte (MAX<sub>VALUE</sub> == 127)


<a id="orgbccacb9"></a>

## Fractional numbers

-   Double (64bit precision)
-   Float (32bit precision)
-   Ratio (1/3 - exact!)


<a id="org352d040"></a>

## Mathematical operations

-   + - \* /
-   = and `= - double equals is more loose
      (` 3 3.0) will be false
    (== 3 3.0) will be true
-   Operations with no terms will give the identity.
    (+) => 0
    (\*) => 1
-   (< 1 2 3) will be true because 1 < 2 < 3
-   (<= 1 1 2) will be true because 1 <= 1 <= 2
-   inc and dec will add and subtract one to a number


<a id="org56ca41c"></a>

## Strings

-   "Surrounded by double quotes"
-   Most things can be coerced to a string with str:
    (str "cat") = (str &rsquo;cat)
-   str can also be used for concatenation
    (str "meow " 3 " times") will be "meow 3 times"
-   re-find is used to find with regular expressions:
    (re-find #"cat" "mystic cat mouse") will return "cat"
-   Regular expressions are #"&#x2026;"


<a id="orgc729aa4"></a>

## Booleans and Logic

-   true, false and nil
-   Everything but false and nil are true!
-   Logical operators:
    -   (and  )
    -   (or   )
    -   (not  )


<a id="orgb41ac2d"></a>

## Symbols

-   &rsquo;str is a symbol
-   (= str clojure.core/str) returns true
-   (name &rsquo;clojure.core/str) returns "str"
-   Symbols `refer` to things and `point` to other values.


<a id="org14f2eb3"></a>

## Keywords

-   Keywords begin with a colon
-   They aren&rsquo;t symbols as they won&rsquo;t be replaced by what they refer to
-   Paired with other values in collections to help look up other values.


<a id="org7b931b5"></a>

## Lists

`Collection` is a group of values
`Containers` provide structure
`Elements` or `Members` are inside of collections
`list` is a type of collection

-   We single quote to prevent lists being evaluated
    &rsquo;(1 2 3)
-   (list 1 2 3)
-   Conjoin lists (conj &rsquo;(1 2 3) 4) => (4 1 2 3)
-   (first &rsquo;(1 2 3)), (second &rsquo;(1 2 3)), (nth &rsquo;(1 2 3), 2)
-   Zero indexed
-   Well suited for small collection or things that are read in linear order. Slow if you want to get arbitrary elements from later.


<a id="orgf3c3c0f"></a>

## Vectors

Square brackets.

-   [1 2 3] Don&rsquo;t need to be quoted as they are evaluated differently from lists.
-   (vector 1 2 3) returns [1 2 3]
-   (vec (list 1 2 3)) returns [1 2 3]
-   (conj [1 2 3] 4) returns [1 2 3 4]
-   first, second and nth work but nth is fast for vectors
-   (rest &#x2026;) and (next &#x2026;) returns everything but the first
-   rest returns () when done and next returns nil
-   (count [1 2 3])
-   (= &rsquo;(1 2 3) [1 2 3]) if they contain the same elements in the same order they are considered equal.


<a id="org2dea891"></a>

## Sets

Unordered collection of value - good for if you plan to ask questions like "does the collection have the number 3 in it?"

-   \#{:a :b :c} => will not always be in the same order.
-   (sort #{:a :b :c}) will return them in order
-   (conj #{:a :b :c} :d)
-   Conjoining will only contain each element once and will discard repeats.
-   (disj #{"cow" "sheep"} #{"sheep"}) will return cow as this is the disjoin of the sets.
-   (contains? #{1 2 3} 3) returns true
-   Make any collection a set with the keyword
    (set (1 2 3))


<a id="orgfeb7d7a"></a>

## Maps

-   Key/Value pairs
-   Surrounded by curly braces {&#x2026;} and filled with alternating keys and values.
-   (get {"cat" "meow" "dog" "woof"} "cat") will return "meow"
-   (get {:a 1 :b 2} :c) - will return false
-   (get {:glinda :good} :wicked :not-here) can provide a default value as the 4th argument.
-   (assoc {:bolts 1088} :camshafts 3) add to a map with assoc
-   (assoc {:camshafts 3} :camshafts 2) if they key already exists the value will be overwritten.
-   (merge {:a 1 :b 2} {:b 3 :c 4}) - this combines maps and will prefer values from the later maps.
-   (dissoc {:potatoes 5 :mushrooms 2} :mushrooms) will remove a key/value pair.

# Functions (verbs)


<a id="org1a77273"></a>

## Let bindings

-   (let [cats 5] (str "I have " cats " cats.")) -> within that expression, cats will be replaced with 5.
-   (let [+ -] (+ 2 3)) -> within that expression, + will be replaced with -.

    (let [person   "joseph"
          num-cats 186]
             (str person " has " num-cats " cats!"))
    (let [cats 3
          legs (* 4 cats)]
             (str legs " legs all together"))

-   Multiple bindings in the [], evaluated in order.

-   `let defines the menaing of symbols within an expression. Not globally scoped.`


<a id="orgcb89ee9"></a>

## Functions

    ((fn [x] (+ x 1)) 2)

-   This is defining the function and passing the value for x at the same time.
-   Functions are declaring the relationship between the arguments and are evaluated later. `let` statements are evaluated immediately.
-   There is a short hand for functions:
    
        (#(+ % 1) 2)
-   This is equivalent to the above statment. `%` takes the place of the first argument, you can see `%1` and `%2` to take the place of the first and second arguments (and so on).


<a id="orge87a4f8"></a>

## Vars

\#+BEGIN<sub>SRC</sub> clojure
 (def cats 5)
\#+END<sub>SRC</sub> clojure

-   Now cats is globally defined as 5.
-   Like symbols, they are references to other values.
-   Symbol -> Var -> Function
    -   We can change the meaning of the var at any time.
    -   The symbol will still point to the var but you can point the var to any function.


<a id="org3124a5b"></a>

## Defining functions

-   Different ways to define named functions:
    
           ;; Using def and fn
           (def half (fn [number] (/ number 2)))
        
        ;; Using a simplier version.
           (defn half [number] (/ number 2))
        
        ;; Defining different function calls defined by different number of arguments.
           (defn half
                 ([]  1/2)
                 ([x] (/ x 2)))
        
        ;; Can take extra optional arguments
        (defn vargs
                 [x y & more-args]
                 {:x    x
                  :y    y
                  :more more-args})
        ;; You have to provide the named args but can have 0-> of the optional args.
        ;; Able to provide doc-strings for the functions.
        (defn launch
          "Launches a spacecraft into the given orbit by initiating a
           controlled on-axis burn. Does not automatically stage, but
           does vector thrust, if the craft supports it."
          [craft target-orbit]
          "OK, we don't know how to control spacecraft yet.")
        
        ;; These automatically generate documentation.


<a id="orgb8a9294"></a>

## How type works

-   Awesome case study here!
    
        ;; Is it a function?
        (fn? type)
        
        ;; What does it's documentation say?
        (doc type)
        
        ;; What about type's meta data?
        (meta #'type)
        
        ;; What about the actual source code?
        (source type)
-   It&rsquo;s so cool to be able to see the source code of the base functions so easily. Can imagine it being a really amazing way to dig deeper - attempting to build your own implementations of base functions and then comparing to the core language.
-   There are core axioms that can&rsquo;t be sources (def and let\*) for example.
