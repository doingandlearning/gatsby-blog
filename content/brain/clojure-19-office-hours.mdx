I've been falling behind in my ClojureFam journey but I'm getting back on the horse!

We had office hours with Jeff today - I was both late and had to leave early but I watched the recording. It was funny, the four of us that were there all asked about where we should be in the curriculum - we're such completor-finisher-wanters-of-stickers :)

Jeff made the point though that learning should be engaging - I know this and talk about it a lot but I'd lost sight of it a bit on this project. I've been doing the readings and the algorithmic practice but I haven't been building as much as I should have been to keep my brain engaged.

Tomorrow, I'm going to dive into ClojureScript and write a web app.
