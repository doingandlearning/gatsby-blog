# Sales Safari


<a id="org3eb8c40"></a>

## Why does Sales Safari matters?

-   All things are marketing - we market to attract, to persuade and to serve.
-   `We market to create and keep our customers.` Drucker
-   `It's like you read my mind.`

## What is the possible outcome of a Safari?

-   ebombs
-   Content that makes people thing - `I would have tried that`
-   We build trust, excitement and investment - sharing is a cost and we need to earn it.

## How do we do it?

There are three ingredients.
We record literal rather than editorial.
More is sometimes better.


<a id="org1a67cc7"></a>

### Pain

-   Feelings around it (anxious/unsure)
-   Facts about an outcome or situation (I want something but I don&rsquo;t know how to do it)
-   Actions triggers (procrastinatin, hoping, looking for alternatives, looking for shortcuts)
    
    `Hope is a smoke signal for pain`


<a id="orgd9226db"></a>

### Jargon

-   Speciality words
    Insider lingo (normal words used inside for different purposes inside a community)


<a id="org023238e"></a>

### Recommendations

-   Advice - do this, try this, don&rsquo;t do this
-   References - read this, listen to this
-   Products - buy this, don&rsquo;t buy this
-   Links
-   Prices

## Where do you Safari?

Waterhole vs Zoo

-   Natural environment vs staged environment
-   Not a focus group, marketing group, cold call
-   A forum, review section, blog thread, comments
-   Github issues/threads
-   Slack/Discord communities


<a id="org75c5508"></a>

## What are the stages?
