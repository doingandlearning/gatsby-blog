# Summary notes:

<a id="org39f3e88"></a>

## Knowledge Hydrants

We tend to overlook older texts and works as defunct and past usefulness - but they can often be hydrants of knowledge.

<a id="org9f8b870"></a>

### Discover the great literature in your profession or area of interest and then beging an earnest study of these works.

- Ask people
- What authors do they like? What are their favourite books? What has profoundly influenced them?
  - Join/form a study group
  - Order the works to be studied
  - Compose an agenda

<a id="org8982997"></a>

## Pool of Insight

> individual study pales in comparison with the study of literature in a
> group dialogue.

Study on one&rsquo;s own and then engage in meaningful dialogue.

- clarify what confused others
- expose your own misunderstandings
- reveal new ideas
- articulate that which you didn't know you knew

<a id="org6c250d0"></a>

### [ ] Book: On Dialogue by David Bohm

In a dialogue everyone wins.

<a id="org25240e8"></a>

### Read and study but discuss with others in a regular study group.

- Safe place
- Common ground
- Public living room
- Motivated moderator
- Prepared participants

<a id="org2897a07"></a>

## Safe place

> Loud-mouths, show-offs, know-it-alls and people who areoverly competitive, adversarial or confrontational, can makeothers uncomfortable or insecure, and create an environment that is not conducive to learning, sharing or the building of ideas.

**building of ideas** - when one wins, we all win. Mutual collaboration.

<a id="orgdc64895"></a>

### [ ] The Learning Organization - Peter M. Senge

\*\*

- Dialogue brings vulnerability - seeing each other as colleagues working toward a common goal can help friendship develop even if there is little in common beforehand. Mutual risk and sense of safety in the face of it.

  Saying no to `hostility` `disrespect` `bullying` `showing off`

<a id="org1692a5e"></a>

## Enduring energy

Starting is easy - keeping going another matter.

- Weekly or fortnightly
- 1-2hr max
- Short break in the middle

<a id="org8d5dafd"></a>

## Kindred Collaborators

Forget networking - learning and growing together inevitably leads to collaboration and growth for all.

<a id="orgbd9c2d6"></a>

## Common Ground

Easy for people to get to but not too close to their offices or homes.

<a id="orgf8e5ee4"></a>

### [?] What does this mean for a remote study group? I imagine any study group I&rsquo;d form/join would be remote (even before Covid!!).

<a id="org46e03ec"></a>

## Public Living Room

Again, I wonder which of these characteristics are relevant to a remote environment - refreshments, warm lighting, different chairs, rearrangable furniture.

<a id="org1d38377"></a>

## Intimate Circle

- 2-8 people

<a id="org6d528f2"></a>

## Virtual Space

- For distributed diary
- Agendas
- [?] Should this be Discord?

<a id="org1bd2e1c"></a>

## Enthusiastic leader

Inform and invite people <- -> Create and stimulate the group
Stimulating events, virtual dialogues, listen to people&rsquo;s ideas!

<a id="orgc80ac8c"></a>

## Motivated Moderator

- Need to stop conversations wander aimlessly, arguments erupying and people talking on top of each other.

<a id="org8a489c7"></a>

### [?] How can you become a great moderator? Besides being knowledgeable about the literature over which you moderate.

- Prepare throughly
- Ask the opening question (challenging, penetrating to establish engaging and enlightening discussion)
- Resuscitate deteriorating dialogues
- Handle side conversations
- Refocus by reading
- Let people speak
- Challenge groundless criticism
- Rotate moderators
- Politeness and patience

<a id="orgb6e16a2"></a>

## Active participant

- Each participant is empowered by use the study group as their tool for growth.
- Form subgroups
- Inform when something is or isn&rsquo;t working
- Moderate
- Never stop learning

<a id="orgece3645"></a>

## Prepared Participant

- Without studying individuals generally add to little or too much.
- Read and note:
  - What you did and did not understand
  - What you thought the key points were
  - What you did not agree with
  - What ideas related to other writings
  - How the work could be improved

<a id="orgfc66497"></a>

## Distinguished Participant

Bringing someone who is well-known to raise the status of the group and the importance of the interactrions. Recognising that 1-2-1 and small group is a better form of learning and knowledge transfer than lectures.

<a id="orgd8da448"></a>

## Opening Question

Thinking deeply about the opening question that can set up the conversation and the time together is a key skill.

<a id="org4b171ff"></a>

## Sequential Study

- Study literature chronologically for maximum comprehension.

<a id="orgd339cbf"></a>

## Agenda

- Create and publish an agenda with at least 3-6 weeks worth of planned meetings.

<a id="org61616cb"></a>

## Subgroup

Why?

- Too many people show up
- People want to study different literature
- Someone may want to study something relevant that no one else is studying
- A study group needs new members

<a id="orgaf5f845"></a>

## Study Cycles

Package readings into collections, which a group of individuals may undertake to study. Combine the study cycle with a SUBGROUP, which will repeat the cycle over and over as long as there is interest.

This feels like the trail group concept that Joel was talkign about.

<a id="org23702f1"></a>

## Distributed Diary

- Everyone write 2-3 senstences which they think capture the most important ideas
- Someone compiles them and writes a &rsquo;diary&rsquo; based on the notes.

<a id="orgfa96eed"></a>

## Afterhours

- Head to the pub afterwards.
