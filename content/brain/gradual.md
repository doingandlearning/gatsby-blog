- **tags:** Philo, Learning

A peer to peer platform to share skills.

I love the name - this isn&rsquo;t Matrix-style download everything from my brain into yours - this is small, gradual sharing and learning.

Three stages atm:

# Map:

Find latent talents and unspoken learning desires within a community.

Encouraging people to recognise their latent talents and share them is a tricky one. Some people open up to questionairres - others find them hard to cope with. Conversation is an obvious next strategy and given that this is a community driven approach wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily have to **scale**. Mapping is an interesting word as well - the visual description of a complex field &#x2026; graph network of learnings and learners. The growing graph could also be a stimulus for community members to think of areas of learning/knowledge they may have forgotten about.

## How?

- Typeform
- Informal conversations

# Match

Connect existing skills with the needs of people close to you.

Loving the **closeness** - I&rsquo;m assuming this means relational rather than physical. The learning is done in community. Matching could be a group of learners who can journey together, 1-1, a building of learning resource, a matching of peers, mentors, fellow travellers.

# Meet:

Facilitate human connection so that an exchange can take place.

I really like the focus on human connection - this is learning in relationship and community, not an online course. Been thinking a lot about study groups recently - as adventuring groups (like in Dungeons and Dragons) - see [[Knowledge Hydrants]]. This is maybe slightly tangential to this model as it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need an **expert** and could be made up of mutual explorers.

## How?

# Next:

This is a really exciting idea. I love the thought of being able to use your community to learn and grow in and from. Learning/adventuring together strengthens community and with an ethos of welcoming, learning and openness can foster a really positive force.
