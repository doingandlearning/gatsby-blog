    I think today has been another go at recursion. I studied and taught Maths for decades, so I understand recursion theoretically - proof by induction is my favourite kind of proof. I like seeing recursive programs and can follow their logic but I can never come up with the ideas myself. I like my procedurial and iterative approaches. I think I'm starting to like recursion.

# Brave and True

I've been continuing to read the Brave and True. We've been chatting in our ClojureFam cohort about it being easier to grok because it's punchier and funnier than the previous text. I think this is probably true.

As Clojure prefers immutable structures and data-types recursion is the way to go. I learnt the we use recur because Clojure isn't optimised for tail recusion (something I learnt about when we looked briefly at Erlang).

The book walks through how to built a terminal game. It was quite interesting - I can see how to get input now, which was something that I was wondering about. It's an interesting paradigm shift to move from modifying the data to be what you want it to be rather than creating a brand new object.

# Other things

There hasn't been a lot of time to be able to try some of the problems today. I've managed 1 or 2 but will look at more tomorrow.
