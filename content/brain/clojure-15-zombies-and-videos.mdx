# Parens of the Dead

I found this web-series of a speed coding with Clojure. I'm watching it in 2x and enjoying seeing someone using Emacs confidently for coding. I want to get to that stage and be able to move my development over to Emacs. I am for Clojure but not for my day to day.

# Reading

I'm still reading and it's a bit of a slog at the moment. Recently, other things like streaming have been competing for my attention. I'm going to try to give meaningful time to my reading tomorrow.

# Sync

I feel in need of another sync learning session with someone. We have office hours later in the week so that should be cool - I'm trying to list questions for that before we get there.

# Videos

I've been watching more videos in the background - soaking up Clojure vibes. Nothing has particularly stood out yet but that's because I'm not giving it full attention or taking notes.
