# Setup

Really clear setup - I&rsquo;d done the workshop before so I had to drop the tables but that was fine. :)

<a id="org3fbb3c7"></a>

# 01 - Import Data

I&rsquo;m confused - I understand the goal but this exercise is asking me to import data without a link to the data I&rsquo;m required to import<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. That would be helpful here. I get that these were running alongside the lessons and I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;ll be surfaced when done but for me landing in this repo this was a bit baffling.

- I clicked through to the linked lesson
- I clicked through to the code repo
- I see 3 csv files and I&rsquo;m not sure if I need to do all or just one of them.
- Flicking back to the exercise shows I need to import all three

- The columns in the CSV are labelled differently from the columns we defined in the setup. The original linked lesson doesn&rsquo;t deal with mapping incoming columns to current columns with different names. This is actually fine if you just call out the columns in the correct order as per the lesson.

ðŸ§  To describe a table `\d+ <table_name>`

- The setup had us define the user_handle column as an integer but the data has the user_handle as a UUID. I dropped the users table, replaced int for uuid and Bob&rsquo;s your Uncle :)
- The purchases table has the same problem in setup. user_handle and sku should both be UUIDs

```sql
create table purchases (
  date date,
  user_handle uuid,
  sku uuid,
  quantity int
);
```

```sql
    copy purchases (date, user_handle, sku, quantity) from '/Users/kevin/code/egghead/sql-advanced/sql-advanced-purchases.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

- I can&rsquo;t find the products CSV anywhere.

# 02 - Cast INT to String

Hmm - this exercise could be clearer. Is there a specific context I need to cast the Int to string? The description [here](https://github.com/twclark0/sql-advanced/blob/master/03_casting-types/notes.md) is slightly more helpful but again doesn&rsquo;t seem to tell me what is required. I&rsquo;m not clear if the goal of these exercises is to be as generic as possible but this feels like a riddle rather than an exercise.

Anyway, I did:

```sql
select cast (user_handle as text) from users;
```

and

```sql
select user_handle::text from users;
```

Though this is casting a UUID to a string I&rsquo;m taking it :)

# 03 - Enum

Okay - I understand this exercise :) Actually, this is really good - I like the presentation as an actual user problem - could all the exercises be cast in this light?

<a id="orga69ce78"></a>

## 1: You&rsquo;ve got this data to import - here are the files and there is the db structure

<a id="orgc1b04ef"></a>

## 2: The user id is currently an int, the front end needs it as a string, construct the query for this.

- create type role as enum (&rsquo;buyer&rsquo;, &rsquo;seller&rsquo;, &rsquo;admin&rsquo;);
- alter table users add column role role;
- \d+ users;

Nice! :)

# 04 - Profile Queries

Again, love the problem statement! <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>

```sh
=postgres=# explain analyze select * from users where age < 40;
                                             QUERY PLAN

---

 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..15.12 rows=137 width=168) (actual time=0.013..0.031 rows=39 loops=1)
   Filter: (age < 40)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 62
 Planning Time: 0.051 ms
 Execution Time: 0.051 ms
(5 rows)

postgres=# explain analyze select * from users where age > 40;
                                            QUERY PLAN

---

 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..3.26 rows=60 width=54) (actual time=0.012..0.030 rows=60 loops=1)
   Filter: (age > 40)
   Rows Removed by Filter: 41
 Planning Time: 0.242 ms
 Execution Time: 0.048 ms
(5 rows)=
```

<a id="orgb6f1870"></a>

# 05 CTE

ðŸ§  postgres doesn&rsquo;t like "" only &rsquo;&rsquo;

```sql
select user_handle, sku,
(select avg(quantity) from Purchases
  where user_handle = p.user_handle and sku = p.sku
) from Purchases p
group by user_handle, sku;
```

Attempted refactor:

```sql
with average_purchases as (
  select user_handle, sku, avg(quantity) from purchases group by user_handle, sku
)
select * from average_purchases;
```

Is this better? It is probably reuseable but I don&rsquo;t know if it is what the exercise is asking for.

I&rsquo;m struggling to parse the second part of this exercise. I&rsquo;m going with:
On average how much does a user purchase of every product?

Two possible thoughts:

- Total of product sold/total of users who bought it
- Avg of product bought/total of user who bought it

I think the second on is what is possibly being asked because we are reusing the averages function but it feels like an average of an average and I&rsquo;m worried we&rsquo;re going to cause the next financial crisis :)

```sql
with average_purchases as (
  select user_handle, sku, avg(quantity) from purchases group by user_handle, sku
)
select sku, avg(avg) from average_purchases group by sku;
```

No idea if that&rsquo;s right but I&rsquo;m still not sure I understand the question ðŸ™ƒ

# 06 - Filter Data

I can totally imagine a team asking for this :)

<a id="orgabff8a3"></a>

## First fiddle:

```sql
select purchases.user_handle, sum(purchases.quantity) as total from purchases group by user_handle having sum(purchases.quantity) > 100;
```

<a id="org21d3925"></a>

## Answer

```sql
select email, users.user_handle, age, sum(quantity) as total from users join purchases on (users.user_handle = purchases.user_handle) where age > 19 and age < 30 group by users.user_handle having sum(quantity) > 100;
```

<a id="org9c53dc1"></a>

## Brief attempt to play with CTEs for it

```sql
with over_100_purchases (
select user_handle, sum(quantity) as total from purchases group by user_handle having sum(quantity) > 100
)

select users.email, users.age, over_100_purchases.total FROM users, over_100_purchases where users.user_handle=over_100_purchases.user_handle;
```

<a id="org439eb13"></a>

Again - there&rsquo;s a bit of ambiguity with the next bit. Better if you gave an example product. We&rsquo;re doing more marketing on Product x - what&rsquo;s the demographic breakdown?

- Pick a product: 18302880 | Pepper - Pablano | \$5.28

- What is the average age and gender % for this product?

  ```sh
  postgres=# select email, users.user_handle, age, gender, sum(quantity) as total from users join purchases on (users.user_handle = purchases.user_handle) where sku=18302880 group by users.user_handle;
         email          | user_handle | age | gender | total
  ------------------------<del>-------------</del>-----<del>--------</del>--&#x2013;&#x2014;
  atanslief@berkeley.edu | 16 | 19 | Male | 12
  (1 row)
  ```

Just the one - give that guy a special offer :) Though that&rsquo;s a lot of peppers for 1 19 yo dude!

# 07 - Transactions

The products table doesn&rsquo;t have a stock level quantity - which would be required for this exercise.

I can see how I&rsquo;d do this - something like this:

```sql
start transaction;
do $$
declare
    creditCard int := '12341234';
    productName text := 'Wine - Winzer Krems Gruner';
begin
    if ((select stock_level from product where product = productName) = 0) then rollback;
    end if;
end $$;
update users set credit_card = 12341234 WHERE user_handle = 1;
insert into purchases values (now(), 1,18302897,5);
commit;
```

# Overall thoughts:

- I did this workshop and course a while a go and it was great to revisit it. I think the tasks could use a bit more clarity and structure. I think there are interesting ways they could be presented and I&rsquo;d love to be able to help with that if there was room :)
- Some element of real world tasks is helpful (potentially) - not so much as to be patronising, but enough for the real need for this material to be obvious.

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Okay - I&rsquo;ve just found the **actual** data I needed to find in the repo exercise directory! Whoops! The challenge for me here was that I was in the context of the 01-exercise.md file and was going forward from there to find the data rather than going up to the parent directory. All of my imports are wrong because I&rsquo;m using different data but I&rsquo;m going to keep going :)

<sup><a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a></sup> Okay! Now I need the actual data for these exercises :)

```
