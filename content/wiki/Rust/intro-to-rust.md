I attended a workshop by Pascal Precht on Rust. I've looked at C before but most of my paid coding has been in weakly typed languages (PHP, Python and JS). The workshop was great and the short course that came out of it was excellent. My notes are [here](https://github.com/eggheadio-projects/write-your-first-program-with-the-rust-language) and the course is [here](https://egghead.io/courses/intro-to-rust).
