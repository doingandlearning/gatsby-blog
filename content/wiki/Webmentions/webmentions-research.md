# What are webmentions?

- W3C standard - full recommendation in Jan 2017
- A standardized protocol that enables one website to inform another that it has been mentioned.
- Integrations with Twitter (using brid.gy mostly (only??))
- Avoids silos
- Major iteration of pingbacks and trackbacks

# How are people using Webmentions?

- Facepile -> sort of like what I&rsquo;m doing but have icons showing the difference between likes and retweets
- Reproduce the Twitter interface at the bottom
