I had the privilege to spend a lot of time in Kent C. Dodds workshops learning about React. I program in React a lot but these workshops really helped to solidify my knowledge. Here are my posts exploring what I learnt.

- [React fundamentals](/posts/react-fundamentals/)
- [React Hooks](/posts/react-hooks/)
- [Building React Apps](/posts/building-react-apps/)
- [Advanced React Hooks](/posts/advanced-hooks/)
- [Advanced React Patterns](/posts/kcd-advanced-patterns/)
- [React Performance](/posts/kcd-react-performance/)
- [React Suspense](/posts/kcd-react-suspense/)
- [Building React Apps (Advanced)](/posts/kcd-building-react-apps-2/)

Given that this was more contact time than a lot of my modules at University, I learnt loads. Not just about React but about well-delivered online workshops.
