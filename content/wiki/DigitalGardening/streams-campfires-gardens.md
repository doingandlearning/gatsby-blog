[Streams, campfires, gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/)

- **Streams** - this is something like twitter - it flows, if you catch it great
  but if you miss more than likely you'll not see it at all.

- **Campfires** - These are spaces where you gather people around a shared focus
  and discuss. This could be a blog or a web space, it could be an online community.

- **Gardens** - A place to store and evolve deeper longer-term thinking. We tend
  gardens, weed them, plant new seeds.
