I love learning new things. Often, when I have a lot on I get excited about a new learning adventure. Right now, I have a lot on. This, then, seems a perfect time to start a new learning adventure!

As I’ve mentioned before [here](https://www.kevincunningham.co.uk/posts/pillars-of-learning/), when it comes to learning new things I have three pillars I use to help me:

## Learn in public

This mini adventure will last for 30 days. Here is what I’m committing to:

- I’m going to post daily about my learning journey of Typescript. I’ll post what I’ve learnt and what I think might be useful.
- I’m going to use Notion to keep my plan and evolving set of questions and answers. That’ll stay open and you can check it out [here](https://www.notion.so/Typescript-33bbd192704243029147f8fbdf1ad269)
- At the end of the 30 days, I’ll post a round up and next steps.

## Work in a group

My next pillar of learning adventures is learning in a group. I don’t have a group lined up for this one but will happily have company on the journey. I’ll do a few streams and see if I can invite anyone else to help me out.

Let me know if you want to join, let me know and I can work out what that would look like.

## Create things

While learning I will deliberately learn and create things. I’ll probably use Colby’s [50 React Projects](https://50reactprojects.com) for inspiration or think about how I might use it in work.

I’m excited about this and have high hopes. I’d like it to make me a better JavaScript developer and to keep me enthused about the other projects that are going on at the moment.
