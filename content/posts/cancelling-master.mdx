Language has meaning. Words have meaning. The metaphors we use have meaning. 
Even if we feel we are careful and try to communicate peacefully, we don't need 
to leverage language that is triggering or unhelpful.

The tech community have been reflecting on ways in which language has not been 
inclusive and has been alienating to others - particularly our black friends and 
colleagues. That we still use blacklists and whitelists for good and bad or refer
to devices as Master and Slave shows there is a way to go.

When you create a new Git project, it defaults to creating a master branch as the
one branch to rule them all. I don't find that language helpful and don't feel it
is necessary. So, I've been changing all of my default branches to `main` or 
`production`. It's not always clear how so I made a few videos about it.

First, how to do it with a newly minted and fresh repo:

<EggheadEmbed
  lessonLink="https://egghead.io/lessons/git-configure-a-new-github-repo-to-use-a-different-default-branch"
  lessonTitle="Configure a New Github Repo to Use a Different Default Branch"
/>

And, secondly how to do it with an existing Github repo:

<EggheadEmbed
  lessonLink="https://egghead.io/lessons/git-configure-an-existing-github-repo-to-use-a-different-default-branch"
  lessonTitle="Configure an existing Github repo to use a different default branch"
/>

Black Lives Matter. Let's make sure our language always reflects that.
